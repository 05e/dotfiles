# dotfiles
These are the dotfiles i use for my customized experience. 

I use different branches for macos and linux so i don't have to install both on when I only need one.

### macos

The macos dotfiles are pretty much the only reason i still mantain this repo. 
They are always being updated and adjusted to my preference. 

It includes an installation script that does everything for you, you can learn more about that in the macos folder :)

### linux 

Note that the linux dotfiles are really bad for the following reasons:
1. I havent actually used linux in ages
2. When i wrote them i had no idea about how to create dotfiles properly and setup an installation
3. When i was using linux my taste was awful and those configurations most likely don't reflect what I would want to work with today

I hope to be able to update the linux dotfiles soon :)
